The Arrow Cloud data center is located in the Oregon, USA region. Your application users may be anywhere, so it's important to understand how you can reduce network latency in your application.    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \">    <p>\n<strong class=\" \">Use data caching</strong>. Using an in-memory data cache in your Arrow Cloud application, when possible, to minimize network requests or file reads, can significantly improve overall application performance. For instance, if your application makes a query that is not very time-sensitive, cache the result of the first query for an appropriate period of time.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>\n<strong class=\" \">Minimize the size of the response payload.</strong> Enable ZIP data compression in your responses, and only include data that is essential to the current state of the application. A common approach to improve mobile application performance is to use one API call to synchronously retrieve a minimum data set to display on the device, and then one or more asynchronous calls to load additional data, as needed.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>\n<strong class=\" \">Avoid using Arrow Cloud to transfer large sets of data to clients</strong>. If your application aggregates large sets of data that don't change often, you can increase performance by uploading those assets to an online storage or content-delivery service, such as <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon S3</a> or <a class=\"external-link external-link\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon CloudFront</a>. The client would make an API call to Arrow Cloud to obtain the URL of the CDN-hosted data, and then make another API call using this URL to download the real data.    </p>\n</li><li class=\" \">    <p>\n<strong class=\" \">Use a CDN to store static contents</strong>. In general, your application should not be used to serve lots of static assets. Developers are encouraged to move all of their application's static contents to a CDN (Amazon CloudFront, for example) and have the client load those assets from there.    </p>\n</li></ul>    </div>\n    <div class=\"section section-2 \" id=\"43299647_ArrowCloudBestPractices-ImprovingApplicationPerformanceandMemoryUsage\">\n        <h2 class=\"heading \"><span>Improving Application Performance and Memory Usage</span></h2>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\" \">    <p>\n<strong class=\" \">Minimize output logs.</strong> To improve application performance and reduce memory consumption, minimize the amount of console logs your application produces.    </p>\n</li></ul>    </div>\n        </div><a id=\"editButton\" href=\"https://wiki.appcelerator.org/pages/editpage.action?pageId=43299647\"><span>Edit</span></a>\n    \n        <div class=\"footer\">\n            Created with <a href=\"http://k15t.com/display/web/Scroll-Wiki-EclipseHelp-Exporter-for-Confluence\" target=\"_blank\">Scroll EclipseHelp Exporter for Confluence</a>.\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n","title":"Arrow Cloud Best Practices"});

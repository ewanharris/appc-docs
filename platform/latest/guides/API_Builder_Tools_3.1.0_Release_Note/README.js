Now, the initial project created by <tt class=\"\">appc new</tt> command has been updated to remove unnecessary dependencies and to provide extra examples on how to test endpoints and models. Additionally, the <tt class=\"\">grunt</tt> command is no longer used for the build. The <tt class=\"\">npm test</tt> command is used instead. Also, the <tt>example.md</tt> web route has been removed. </span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span> </p> </li><li> <p> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Previously, when editing flows, it was not possible to see previously used and available selectors. Now, when editing a selector any previously used selector, or any available selector is displayed in a context-assisted drop-down menu that shows the selector or selectors that match the input text. </span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span> </p> </li><li> <p> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Previously, the <tt>axway-flow-sdk</tt> would generate projects that required transpiling with babel before they could be used. Now, the generated projects do not require transpiling; so the babel dependency has been removed, but the generated projects require a Node.js version equal to or greater than 8.9.x instead. </span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span> </p> </li><li> <p> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Previously, the API SDK generator was used to generate software development kits based on integrated SDK templates. Now, the API Builder SDK generator has been deprecated and the API Builder application exposes its APIs definitions using a standard Swagger format. These API definitions can be consumed by third-party SDK generators to create clients. </span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span> </p> </li><li> <p> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Previously, the API SDK generator was used to generate software development kits based on integrated SDK templates.

Now, locally developed flow-node dependencies in the <tt class=\"\">./nodes/node_modules</tt> folder will be ignored and any flow-node dependency that is required must be added and resolved via the API Builder application&apos;s <tt>package.json</tt> instead. </span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span> </p> </li><li> <p> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Previously, API Builder would not handle JSON schema references on startup and could generate invalid Swagger definitions that were missing the global schema references.

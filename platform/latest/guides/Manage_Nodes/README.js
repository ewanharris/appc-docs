The API Orchestration user interface is divided into the following panels: </p> <ul class=\"\"><li class=\"ux-has-slash-separator\"> <p>Flow-node list (left side of the API Orchestration user interface) - Provides a graphical listing of the Model and Core flow-nodes. The default Core flow-node types are Custom, Codeblock, Compose, Condition, Delay, HTTP, JSON, and Set Context. A model flow-node is displayed for each configured model and an endpoint flow-node is displayed for each imported endpoint. </p> </li><li> <p>Flow editor (center of the API Orchestration user interface) - Provides a graphical space to view, edit, and create flows. </p> </li><li> <p>Flow-node configuration (right side of the API Orchestration user interface) - Provides the functionality to configure the Name, Method, Parameters, and Outputs of flow-nodes. </p> </li></ul> <p>API Orchestration user interface example: </p> <p> <img src=\"images/download/attachments/51252726/api_orchestration.png\" alt=\"images/download/attachments/51252726/api_orchestration.png\" class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" width=\"800\"> </img></p> <p>The procedures in this topic appear in the most probable configuration order. To manage API endpoints, refer to <a class=\"document-link\" href=\"#!/guide/Manage_Endpoints\">Manage Endpoints</a>.

The flow-node will automatically align with any additional flow-nodes in the flow. A warning message may be displayed and the flow-node may be highlighted until it is configured. </p> </li></ol> </div> <div class=\"section section-2\" id=\"src-51252726_ManageNodes-Configureflow-nodes\"> <h2 class=\"heading\"><span>Configure flow-nodes</span></h2> <p>To configure flow-nodes in a flow: </p> <ol class=\"\"><li> <p>Select a flow-node on the flow editor panel to configure its properties. </p> </li><li> <p>If necessary, select and change the default flow-node name. Flow-node naming should reflect the function of the flow-node. </p> </li><li class=\"\"> <p>Select a <strong class=\"\">Method</strong> from the Method drop-down menu.

If <strong class=\"\">selector</strong> is selected from the <i class=\"\">selector</i> drop-down menu, as you begin typing in the <strong class=\"\">parameter</strong> field, a drop-down menu of valid or previously used selector options is displayed. You may optionally choose a selector from the list, or continue typing to manually configure the parameter. For additional selector auto-complete information, refer to <a class=\"document-link\" href=\"#!/guide/Manage_Nodes-section-src-51252726_ManageNodes-Selectorautocomplete\">Selector and output auto-complete</a>. Note that the parameter entries are dependent on the selected flow-node method.

For additional information on the Model and General flow-node output configuration for each method, refer to <a class=\"document-link\" href=\"#!/guide/Flow_Orchestration\">Flow Orchestration</a>. Once the flow-node is properly configured, the warning message is longer displayed and the flow-node is longer highlighted. </p> </li></ol> <div class=\"section section-3\" id=\"src-51252726_ManageNodes-SelectorautocompleteSelectorandoutputauto-complete\"> <h3 class=\"heading\"><span id=\"src-51252726_ManageNodes-Selectorautocomplete\" class=\"confluence-anchor-link\"/><span>Selector and output auto-complete</span></h3> <p>W <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> hen you edit a selector or an output parameter. any previously used or valid selectors or outputs are displayed in a context-assisted drop-down menu that shows the selectors or outputs that match the input text. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> You may optionally choose a selector or output from the list, or continue typing to manually configure the parameter. </span> <br> </br></span> </p> </div> </div> <div class=\"section section-2\" id=\"src-51252726_ManageNodes-Connectflow-nodes\"> <h2 class=\"heading\"><span>Connect flow-nodes</span></h2> <p> </p> <div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-note aui-message warning shadowed information-macro\"> <p>All API endpoint flows begin with a default Start flow-node. </p> </div> <p>Start flow-nodes can only be connected to one other flow-node in the flow.

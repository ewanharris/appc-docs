This is in contrast to web-based solutions that deliver functionality via an enhanced web view. Titanium, not wanting to be limited by the native web view, has engaged in a much deeper integration with the underlying platforms. This gives Titanium developers the ability to leverage native UI components &amp; services, as well as near-native performance, features you won&apos;t find in other cross-platform mobile development solution. In addition, you&apos;ll have access to other features like: </p> <ul class=\"\"><li> <p>Platform specific APIs </p> </li><li> <p>Location-based services </p> </li><li> <p>Social sharing </p> </li><li> <p>Rich multimedia </p> </li><li> <p>Online and on-device data </p> </li><li> <p>Extensibility </p> </li><li> <p>and much more! </p> </li></ul> <p>Titanium empowers you to create immersive, full-featured applications that go beyond the boundaries of the browser. We do the heavy-lifting on cross platform compatibility so you don&#x2019;t have to. Featuring over 80%code reuse across mobile apps, Titanium provides a deep, yet highly-reusable development platform. Appcelerator licenses Titanium under the Apache 2 license and is free for both personal and commercial use. </p> <p>In this chapter, you&apos;ll and learn the basics of writing cross-platform mobile apps with Titanium and become familiar with resources available to you.

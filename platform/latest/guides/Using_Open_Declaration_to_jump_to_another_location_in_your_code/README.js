This makes it easy for you to access that function in case you are not using content assist or have not yet documented that function. </p> <p>If you call a function that was originally declared in another file or even in another project, you can still use Open Declaration as long as you added a project reference to the project containing function. </p> </div> <div class=\"section section-2\" id=\"src-30083308_UsingOpenDeclarationtojumptoanotherlocationinyourcode-Instructions\"> <h2 class=\"heading\"><span>Instructions</span></h2> <p>To jump to a source location in your code: </p> <ol class=\"\"><li> <p>Place your cursor on the item you are referencing. </p> </li><li class=\"\"> <p>Press <strong class=\"\">F3</strong> to jump to the place where you declared the item.

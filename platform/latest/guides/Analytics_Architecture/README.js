This event is only sent once on the first launch of the application after it has been installed or updated.    </p>\n    <p class=\"p2\">\nThe <tt class=\" \">ti.foreground</tt> event is generated each time the activity calls the <tt class=\" \">onResume()</tt> method. The event is queued and is only sent if this is not the first event and the <tt class=\" \">ti.background</tt> event has not been generated recently. If a <tt class=\" \">ti.background</tt> event was processed within the last 30 seconds*, this indicates that a new activity is being opened on top of an old activity. A possible scenario is if you hit the Home button, then reopen the app quickly resulting in a <tt class=\" \">ti.foreground</tt> event to be placed on top of a <tt class=\" \">ti.background</tt> event. In this case, both events are removed from the queue and the current session is still active.    </p>\n    <p class=\"li4\">\nThe <tt class=\" \">ti.background</tt> event is generated when the activity calls the <tt class=\" \">onPause()</tt> method, which occurs in the following scenarios:    </p>\n<ul class=\" \"><li class=\"li6 \">    <p>\nA new activity opens on top of the current activity, so the current activity (A1) is being replaced by a new activity (A2). In this scenario, the old activity (A1) would receive an <tt class=\" \">onPause()</tt> call, which generates a <tt class=\" \">ti.background</tt> event, then within a short period, the new activity (A2) would start and receive its <tt class=\" \">onResume()</tt> call, which generates a <tt class=\" \">ti.foreground</tt> event. Both of these event are removed from the queue, marking the current session as still active.    </p>\n</li><li class=\"li6 \">    <p>\nThe application is placed in the background by hitting the Home button or Power button. In this scenario, the current activity receives an <tt class=\" \">onPause()</tt> call, which generates a <tt class=\" \">ti.background</tt> event to be placed in the event queue, which is sent after a small threshold of time to ensure a <tt class=\" \">ti.foreground</tt> event is not generated.    </p>\n</li></ul>    <p class=\"li6\">\nHaving <tt class=\" \">onPause()</tt> generate the <tt class=\" \">ti.background</tt> event ensures that it is generated in cases where the app was forced killed by the user or by the system due to low memory. The same case would be applicable in the scenario where the current activity is the only activity in the stack and it is closed by backing out of the application using the Back button until the application closes.    </p>\n    <div class=\"confbox admonition admonition-note aui-message warning shadowed information-macro\">\n        \n    <p>\n(*) The default timeout is 30 seconds.

Implementation happens by launching the same number of docker containers for the new publish as existing containers. New and existing containers run in parallel for a while before the new containers go online and the previously existing containers are destroyed. This is process is safe and will provide smooth upgrades for apps.    </p>\n    <p>\nHowever, it may not be desired in some cases since the process needs twice as many resources (containers) when upgrading. This issue becomes significant when an app uses many containers. For example, if an app runs 100 containers, and upgrade would require an additional 100 containers. Even though the old 100 containers will be destroyed after the upgrade is complete, this process may not be affordable.    </p>\n    <p>\nAs an alternative to this expensive process, we provide support of in-place upgrading. This process will not require any additional containers but it will cause some downtime.    </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"section section-2 \" id=\"46245227_In-placeAppUpgrading-NewZero-downtimeupgradingProperty\">\n        <h2 class=\"heading \"><span>New  Zero-downtime upgrading  Property</span></h2>\n    <p>\nA new property has been added to manage &quot;zero-downtime upgrading&quot; (enabled by default).    </p>\n    <p>\n        <img src=\"images/download/attachments/46245227/image2015-12-18_11-37-54.png\" alt=\"images/download/attachments/46245227/image2015-12-18_11-37-54.png\" class=\"confluence-embedded-image\"/>\n            </p>\n    <p>\nAs illustrated in the image above, <tt class=\" \">Zero-downtime upgrading</tt> is set to true.
